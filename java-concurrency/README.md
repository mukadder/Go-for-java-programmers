Code used in https://dev.to/napicellatwit/go-for-java-developers-or-is-the-java-concurrency-that-bad-6ff

I am by no means an expert in Go, indeed quite the opposite. I am currently trying to get familiar with it.
I started getting familiar with the syntax, the memory and the concurrency model. As usual for me, I am trying to contrast it with something I already know, like Java.
So I stumbled in this interesting talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c_tQ6_3cCg) and not far in the talk the great (https://twitter.com/Sajma) introduced the Go concurrency model with some examples. 
The slides for the talk and the examples are here (https://talks.golang.org/2015/go-for-java-programmers.slide#1). Not far in the talk, a question poped up: think about what it would take to implement the same thing in other languages like Java.
Is it really that hard? I was not that sure, I mean, Java does not have a 'select' statement, neither it has build in channels, but it should not be difficult to replicate the examples in Java or is it?
